# Robust Meta Reinforcement Learning (RoML)

This repo implements RoML on top of the [MAML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) algorithm for meta learning.
RoML (Robust Meta Reinforcement Learning) is a meta-algorithm that takes a meta-learning baseline algorithm, and generates a robust version of it.

RoML was originally developed for reinforcement learning problems, but is demonstrated here to be applicable to supervised meta learning as well.
For the demonstration, the toy sine-regression problem is used.
To reproduce the experiments, just run the jupyter notebook in the *Sine* directory.

See [here](https://github.com/ido90/RobustMetaRL) more details about what is RoML and how to use it in general.
